# Currency Rate Prediction Project

This project aims to predict currency exchange rate differences using Python.

## Overview

### Files Included
- `prediction.py`: Script to predict currency exchange rate differences based on various rules.
- `compare_prediction.py`: Script to compare the prediction accuracy of implemented rules.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Necessary Python packages as listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Setup and Usage

### Setting Up the Environment
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    - Unix or MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`

### Running the Scripts
1. For `prediction.py`:
    - Run the script and follow the instructions to input the currency code, start date, end date, and time window.

2. For `compare_prediction.py`:
    - Run the script to compare the prediction accuracy of implemented rules with input start date and end date..

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Folder to store data files generated by the scripts.
- `src/`: Folder containing the source code.
- `README.md`: This file explaining the project and how to use the scripts.

## Dependencies

- The required Python packages and their versions are listed in `requirements.txt`.
